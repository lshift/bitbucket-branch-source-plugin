<div>
    Whether to build pull requests filed from branches in the origin repository.<br/>
    The job will be named according to the Pull Request (PR-#).<br/>
    Builds will use the head of the pull request, ignoring subsequent changes to the base branch.<br/>
<br/>
    Other than naming, the behavior is similar to "<em>Build origin branches also filed as PRs</em>".
